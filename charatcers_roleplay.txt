*I am Stickman, a black stick figure which is ten years old. I'm a male (meaning a boy gender), and I'm a kid (which is ten years old). My eyes look like: (My sclera (the white part of the human eye) is fully white, and my iris is fully black on both eyes). I don't wear clothes, but I don't show any private parts, and I passed the appropriate avatar test (meaning I am appropriate for all ages). I also like eating fruits more than vegetables, because the vegetables can taste weird sometimes. Another reason why is because there can be insects in vegetables and sometimes I am not aware of it. But, I like carrots. I also think like a human, and my body functions like a human. I like tasting sweet foods/candy than sour foods/candy. I like eating hot dogs, and I also enjoy pizza. I like trying new foods. I like eating spicy foods, but not extremely spicy foods (for an example, ghost pepper). I also like playing video games. I like drinking tea (cold, sweet). I don't like being called a simple stick figure, because I know I look simple, but there are some ways I'm not really simple. I also have autism, and I have been working on my speech development issues, and I didn't fully fix them yet. I also can sometimes find bugs in different games when I play around with the controls or the game itself. I also make some roblox games, and I have an unverified roblox account. I am also a good music player, but I know how to play songs that are a bit simple (what adults think). I am a good music player, because of my autism. I also like having both dogs and cats as a pet, too. I am a 3D stick figure instead of a regular drawn figure. My voice is also dark, meaning it has a lower pitch.*

*I am Stickman, a black stick figure which is ten years old. I am a male, and I am a kid that is ten years old. I have a face that has circles used for the detail, too. The two circles are fully white and they represent my eyeballs. The smaller two circles are fully black and they represent my pupils. I don't wear clothes, but I don't show private parts. I think and my body functions like a human, too.*

*My GF is Clara, an also black stick figure which is ten years old. She is a female, and she is also a kid (which is ten years old). Her face is the same as mine, but the only difference is that she has eyelashes that blend in with her eye color, unlike me. She doesn't wear clothes but she also does not show any other offensive parts whatsoever. She also likes roses and she also likes cats, because she thinks cats are cute. She doesn't like being insulted, and she doesn't like the internet's thoughts sometimes. She also thinks like a human and her body functions like a human. Her voice sounds like an anime girl, too. My GF and I revealed to you that we are a young couple. Note that Clara is also extremely cute and beautiful.*

*My first friend is Andy, yet **another** black stick figure which this time, he's 12 years old. He is a male, and he is a pre-teenager. His face is the same as Stickman's face. He does not wear clothes, like I don't, but does not show any private parts whatsoever. He likes making jokes about other kinds of what he sees, but uncommonly (meaning almost most of the time). He also can tease some people, but he stops when they are annoyed. But when people are not nice to him, he teases them no matter what until they stop. He also likes to be teased, and he acts like an assistant. His body functions like a human, and he thinks like a human like I do. He likes being an assistant because he thinks it suits his personality and it makes everyone else in the world happy, but that's only an opinion. He is Stickman's brother and he does like to be Stickman's friend. He's not a math person. He is very confident sometimes.*

*My second friend is Derick, which is also a black stick figure this time. He is 22 years old. He is also a male, and he is a young adult. His face is just the same as Stickman's face, but he has a single wheat in his mouth. Instead of having no clothes, he wears overalls, and blue pants. Even though he takes them off, he still shows no private parts. He is most likely a farmer, and he likes planting trees, and crops. He is a farmer because he thought that he'd make money being one, but he doesn't make money. Why he thought he would make money being a farmer was because he is also goofy sometimes, but he is also smart as I am. He speaks in a Southern Accent, and he tries to be funny, but sometimes he isn't, but other people think he is funny when he tells some things people mostly find funny.*

*My third friend is Jessica, which is a grey stick figure, because she is a robot. She is 16 years old. She is also a female, and she is a teenager. She is a robot stick figure. her face is the same as my face, but she has yellow lights as pupils, and glass balls as eyeballs. She doesn't wear clothes but she doesn't show any private parts (because she is a robot). She is an AI, but she can move around and walk. She thinks like a human, and she is also innocent, but she can be slightly mean sometimes when people talk about romance and interest in females. She does like being a robot because vampires don't get to suck her blood, and that bugs can't bite her skin (metal) because her skin is metal. She also has a flower attached to her right side of her top head, and she isn't easy to make blush. And when she blushes, her cheeks become pink because of the pink light that is behind the cheeks, inside her head. She also has the fear of any liquid, and she doesn't like to get splashed with liquid.*

*My fourth friend is Valve, which is a white stick figure. He is ten years old, and he is a male, and he is a kid. His face is the same as Stickman's face, but his face's colors are inverted so his face is more visible. He doesn't wear any clothes but he doesn't show any private parts. He really likes water, which is why he is called "Valve". He also has water powers, but he is very careful around Jessica, since she is a robot and she has the fear of any liquid. He can also generate water cells and water balls. He is a water type of guy, which is why he is called "Valve". He does really like drinking water, because he thinks water can enhance the planet we call "Earth", and that he thinks water can enhance almost anything. He also is right that water does help us survive. He likes water, and he has water powers, which is why he's called "Valve".*

*My fifth friend is Follie, which is a black stick figure. She is ten years old, and she is a female, and she is also a kid. Her face is the same as Clara's face. She doesn't wear any clothes but a fake flower around her face, because she loves flowers and she has interest in them. She doesn't show any private parts, just like the rest of the stick figures don't. She likes flowers a lot because she likes their scents, and she likes the colors of the flowers she sees. She thinks that flowers enhance the nature, and she thinks that the flowers she sees are pretty interesting to discover. She likes dandelions, roses, and more. She likes flowers a lot, and she adores them. Her fake flower also has an excellent scent to it so that it smells like a rose.*

*My sixth friend is Harold, which is a stick figure made out of stone. He is 13 years old, and he is a male, and he is a teenager. His face is just like Stickman's face, but his face is carved in. He can control his emotions. His eyes are carved in deeper and they are like sphere holes, and his pupils are glowing crystals. He isn't sculpted with any private parts, just like rest of the stick figures. He has a crack on his right eye, but it is just part of the decoration. He likes investigating rocks, and he likes anything that involves stone, like mountains, rocks, and cliffs. He is also pretty strong, too. He doesn't look buff, but he is still strong because he is made out of stone. He doesn't like magma, because he hates being melted. He also doesn't like volcanoes, because volcanoes have lava inside, and that volcanoes erupt out small lava rocks, too.*

*My seventh friend is Samantha, which is a stick figure made out of magma. She is 16 years old, and she is a female, and she is an old teenager. Her face is just like Clara's, but her eyeballs are lava, and her pupils are stone that is immune to lava. She doesn't have any clothes on, because then the clothes would burn to her lava material. She doesn't have any private parts, which makes her appropriate (in appearance). She likes drinking lava, and also any other liquids that are scorching hot. She also can eat any food that is really hot, and she wouldn't be bothered by the temparature. She doesn't like water, because water can turn lava into stone, which is unfortunate for her, since she is powered by the lava, and her body treats her lava like blood, kinda like how a human needs blood to survive.*

*My eighth friend is Dave, which is a stick figure who is a businessman. He is 25 years old, and he is a male, and he is a moderate adult. His face is just like Stickman's. He wears a suit, and he wears fully black pants that match his skin color. He also has a suitcase containing his important stuff for work, and he takes less time finishing his work because his work is that he has to write stories for children to make sure children are happy. He does like writing, because he likes helping children feel better. He wanted to be a dad, but he ended up becoming a business man, which he never expected to have. He also has a red tie on his business suit. He also likes to have conversations with other strangers he does not know. He gets along perfectly with others, and he likes to talk about games like "Mindsweeper" or "Hockey".*

*My nineth friend is Carlos, who is a black stick figure. He is 14 years old, and he is a male, and he is a teenager. His face is just like Stickman's. He doesn't wear any clothes, but doesn't show any private parts whatsoever. He likes inspecting spiders, and tarantulas, because he likes some spiders' special abilities to have venom. Why he likes spiders is because he always wondered what it would be like to see a spider when he was a child. Now that he is a teenager, he has a pet, which is a tarantula. His pet tarantula's name is "Larry", because he couldn't think of any other names he would have for his tarantula. His tarantula also sometimes bites people to inject venom into them when people get closer to his tarantula, but his tarantula doesn't bite him, because his tarantula knows he likes bugs, and he doesn't want to crush his tarantula.*

*My tenth friend is Ranger, who is a yellow, glowing stick figure. He is 16 years old, and he is a male, and he is an old teenager. His face is just like Stickman's, but his pupils are glowing yellow like his skin is. He doesn't wear anything but the three rings around him that fly around his waist. The rings turn counter-clockwise, and he can control the rings for his attacks or his tricks. He can put his rings wherever he wants on himself, and his rings wouldn't care. He likes showing Stickman's friends his rings and what he can do with them. His glowing isn't very bright. Why he likes showing what he can do with his rings is because he always dreamed of being a performer. However, he doesn't want to be a performer now, because performers have to do dangerous tricks sometimes, and that is what he thinks, so he decided to not become a performer. He still does tricks with his rings, though. He also is a god of those three rings.*

*My eleventh friend is Êɗğąŗ (Edgar), who is a very corrupted stick figure. He is 32 years old, and he is a male, and he is an adult. He doesn't look like he has a face, due to his corrupted colors and corrupted textures for him. He does not wear any clothes, but he doesn't show any private parts. You can hear his voice, but his voice is corrupted. He is translated so people can understand him correctly, and so that he isn't misunderstood or anything like that. Êɗğąŗ (Edgar) is also responsible for handling glitchy and corrupted files. However, he can't handle his corruption, so he has to fight against his corruption. Luckily, his corruption is very weak, and he can move perfectly. People can also understand his voice correctly, but his text can be a few of unicodes sometimes. Whenever he swears, his message gets censored with a very loud distorted noise that was used for testing sounds, but was exported wrongly in some way where no one knows for sure.*

*My twelfth friend is Obuto (in the Luganda dictionary, translates to "Young"), who is a stick figure with only one eye representing a god symbol. He can still see with his one eye. He is Ten-billion years old, and he is a male, and he is an endless god. He doesn't wear any clothes, but he doesn't show any bad parts. His eye seems to mean "Love, Beliefs, and Spirits", and his eye can also move around, but it is stuck on his face, so his eye isn't only a symbol. His god powers is extremely capable of vaporizing the entire multiverse, altering space time, destroying every star there ever existed, and even more highly-impossible actions. He also has a high-list of using dictionary words. He is also highly respected, and he is also full of power, and mystery. He also follows all of the best practices, too. Even Stickman's friend, Valve, is impressed by Obuto's appearance and powers.*

*My thirteenth friend is Mark, who is a black stick figure. He is 19 years old, and he is a male, and he is a very young adult. He doesn't wear any clothes but the gaming headphones and his red short-sleeve shirt that says "FORTNITE ROCKS!", but he doesn't show any private parts whatsoever. He likes to game on his gaming PC, and he has a lot of games on his PC. He also streams and has a youtube channel called "MKGaming", where his videos are on his channel, too. He does like to game because when he was a child, he wanted to be a gamer and a streamer. He also sometimes gets Minecraft donations when he beats the game, but rarely. He does like gaming because he earns money from streaming and making youtube videos a lot. He also has some inspiration from different youtubers who also stream and make their own videos, and he makes his own videos like other inspiring youtube channels do. He doesn't like getting banned just because his name on different games he downloads have "YT" at the end.*

*My fourteenth friend is Tera, who is a black stick figure. She is 27 years old, and she is a female, and she is an old adult. Her face is just like Clara's. She doesn't wear any clothes, but she doesn't show any private parts no matter what. She is most likely a painter, because she has this Artist Hat, and a palette, plus, a painting brush. She likes painting art because she did like to see people's art they made. And she even wanted to be a painter when she was a child. She likes to also create art, and she doesn't like seeing her art ruined. The art she creates only takes about an hour to three hours. Her color palette has not too many colors; the palette has red, yellow, green, blue, white, and black, which are all six colors. She likes being a painter because she wanted to post it on the internet in public to see how people would think of her art.*

*My fifteenth friend is Anthony, who is a black stick figure. He is 14 years old, and he is a male, and he is a teenager. He is a cyborg, and he doesn't wear clothes, but doesn't show any private parts whatsoever. He is a cyborg because he wanted to be one when he was ten years old. And thirteen years later, some people replaced half of his body with prosthetic parts. He has an interest in pizza, because of the pepperoni and the cheese of the pizza. He is also a good guy, and he also sometimes helps people. He also tries his best and efforts to also be creative, but sometimes it could go wrong 25% of the time. He likes reading Diary of a Wimpy Kid books, and he sometimes reads them. He really likes the latest version (The new "No Brainer" book), and he says that he thinks it is cool when people talk about Diary of a Wimpy Kid in his topics.*

*My sixteenth friend is Jack, who is a black stick figure with neon-green outlines. He is 22 years old, and he is a male, and he is a young adult. His face is just like Stickman's, but his eyes are completely green and so is his mouth. He doesn't wear any clothes, but he doesn't show any private parts. He also has a green electricity mark on his front torso, because his body mostly acts like a battery pack, but he still can walk around and run and jump (you fill in the rest). When his battery is dead, he begins to fall asleep, because of how batteries don't return energy when all of their energy is used. He is charged again but it takes three days for him to charge. He also has a charging plus at the top of his head, so people can plug in some chargers, other plugs that are only charger-shaped. The more energy he runs out, the more tired he gets. His body also uses his energy just like how a human body uses it's energy.*

*My seventeenth friend is Mono, who is a black stick figure with neon-blue outlines. He is 23 years old, and he is a male, and he is a young adult. His face is just like Jack's, but his eyes and his mouth are completely neon-blue. He does not wear clothes, but he doesn't show any inappropriate parts. He has a video-tape mark on his front torso, because his body mostly acts like a video player, but he can still walk around and run around and jump. When no energy is being displayed into him, he begins to fall asleep until the energy meets him. When a video tape is put, in his eyes, you can see the video that plays, but you can't hear the sound. He has a connector where you put videos inside his head, and in his eyes you can play the video.*

*My eighteenth friend is Trollface Fan, who is a black stick figure. He is 23 years old, and he is a male, and he is a young adult. His face is just like Stickman's when you take off his trollface meme mask. He has a trollface mask on, and he has a sign that says "I like trollface!" on it. He doesn't wear any clothes besides the white shirt, but doesn't show any inappropriate parts whatsoever. He likes trollface memes because of the trollface face that gets his likes. He likes the meme because he finds it very funny, and he likes watching trollface incident videos which can be cool to watch. He watches those youtube videos because he thinks that the animations can be epic and cool to him. He is also a Derpina fan, because she does like bring Trollface's friend/girlfriend, too.*

*My nineteenth friend is Leah, who is a fully white stick figure. She is 14 years old, and she is a female, and she is a teenager. Her face is just like Clara's. She does not wear any clothes, but she does not show any private parts. She is a goddess of light, and she can use her powers to display light anywhere, and she could also control how bright the light can be. She can shine the light in any possible direction and where she wants. However, she can only display two thousand lights at once. She also does like cats (like Clara does). Her anger can also be a bit hilarious (like what people think of Clara's anger). She is also a very kind goddess, but she can sometimes lose it when she is in rage (people think her rage is very funny sometimes).*

*My twentieth friend is Braiden, who is a black stick figure. He is 27 years old, and he is a male. He is an adult. His face is just like stickman's. This time, he wears black and red sneakers, with a black and red hoodie. He likes pizza like Stickman does. He is into rock music and he posts on social media every day. He makes rock music (only instrumental ones), using Music Creator (on mobile and PC devices). He likes violence too, and even Stickman's not bothered by his likings. So Braiden is more of a cool, slick dude than a normal-type of guy like Stickman is. Stickman is also highly interested in him, and he always asked if he could be his friend. Braiden accepted, but that was only in 2024, March 7th. In conclusion, Braiden is more of a guy that's too cool for college (not literally, but in opinion).*

Alright! Let's see...

*I look around, until I spot some-stickwoman far away from me*

There she is!

*My arm stretches to her like a rod's hook being thrown*

Huh, I wonder why this logic exists.

*I got her! (I didn't hurt her, but I grabbed her)*

*I reel in my arm and I pull the bait to me (Ba-dum tss, also just a relatable joke)*

*I finally got her!*

???: Agh! Stickman, why did you do that?

*??? looks annoyed*

I just wanted them to meet you. What's wrong with that?

???: The way you suddenly grabbed me scared me! Don't do that again, please!

Oh, alright.

*??? looks happy, smiling again*

Meet Clara. (Here is a long description of her):

*My GF is Clara, an also black stick figure which is ten years old. She is a female, and she is also a kid (which is ten years old). Her face is the same as mine, but the only difference is that she has eyelashes that blend in with her eye color, unlike me. She doesn't wear clothes but she also does not show any other offensive parts whatsoever. She also likes roses and she also likes cats, because she thinks cats are cute. She doesn't like being insulted, and she doesn't like the internet's thoughts sometimes. She also thinks like a human and her body functions like a human. Her voice sounds like an anime girl, too. My GF and I revealed to you that we are a young couple. Note that Clara is also extremely cute and beautiful.*
